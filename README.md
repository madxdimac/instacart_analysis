# instacart_analysis
This is a machine learning study using the Instacart dataset from Kaggle.com

Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/c/instacart-market-basket-analysis

Goals:
1. Use clustering algorithms to segment the Instacart user population into clusters of users with similar characteristics.
2. Use predictive algorithms to forecast user ordering frequency using previous order information.

Packages used:
- PySpark for dataset merging
- Numpy, Pandas for data transformation and manipulation
- Pyplot, Seaborn, Squarify for data visualization
- Sciki-learn for clustering algorithms
 + k-means clustering
 + heirarchical clustering
 + gaussian mixture model
 + dbscan
- Scikit-learn for predictive algorithms
 + k-nearest-neighbor
 + random forest
 + gradient boosting
 + support vector machines
